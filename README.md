# task-6-week-3-Cat-Detection
This project aims to detect cats in static images using OpenCV and a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier. The system identifies cat faces and marks them with bounding boxes.

‚∏ª

üõ† Tools & Technologies:
	‚Ä¢	Programming Language: Python
	‚Ä¢	Library: OpenCV
	‚Ä¢	Detection Model:
	‚Ä¢	haarcascade_frontalcatface.xml
	‚Ä¢	or haarcascade_frontalcatface_extended.xml (for better accuracy)

‚∏ª

‚öô How It Works:
	1.	The user provides an image containing cats.
	2.	The image is converted to grayscale for efficient processing.
	3.	Haar Cascade is used to detect cat faces in the image.
	4.	A bounding box and label (‚ÄúCat‚Äù) are drawn around each detected face.
	5.	The final image with detected cats is displayed to the user.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Features:
	‚Ä¢	Detects cat faces in images quickly and efficiently.
	‚Ä¢	Requires no internet connection or heavy models.
	‚Ä¢	Works on most clear and front-facing cat photos.

‚∏ª

‚ö† Limitations:
	‚Ä¢	The Haar model only detects frontal cat faces.
	‚Ä¢	May not detect cats in side profiles, occlusions, or poor lighting.
